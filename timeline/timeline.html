            <p>Well, look who just showed up…</p>
            <p>
              Mr. Prince Charming.<br>
              Mr. “How-Am-I-Supposed-To-Stay-Cool-When-You-Look-At-Me-Like-That.”<br>
              The guy who somehow makes my heart race <em>every</em> single time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Welcome to our special little place on the internet — made with love, a lot of happy memories, and maybe
              just a <em>tiny</em> bit of nervous excitement.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn’t just a website. It’s our story — full of laughs, sweet surprises, and moments that made me fall
              (hard) for you.<br>
              Think of it like our own little movie.<br>
              No drama (unless we want to add it for fun). Just real, silly, sweet, heart-melting moments between two
              people who were clearly meant to meet.
            </p>
            <p>Inside, you’ll find:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Flirty moments that made me smile like an idiot</li>
              <li>Memories I keep playing in my head</li>
              <li>And way too many cheesy compliments (get ready)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So scroll down and take a little trip back with me.<br>
              Remember how it all started — with one shake, one bench, and one crazy-strong feeling that something
              special was about to begin.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn’t just a story.<br>
              It’s a love note — just for you.
            </p>
            <p>And guess what?<br>You're the main character babe.</p>

        <h2>🥤 Date 1: Shake & Sea</h2>
        <p>
          No pics, no proof — but trust me, we were dangerously cute. Like suspiciously adorable. We started with Rebar
          shakes. I carefully picked a flavour, put some thought into it… and you? You just looked at me, smiled, and
          said, “I’ll have the same.” No hesitation. No checking the menu. Just straight-up trust. Or laziness. Still
          not sure. British bravery or just classic first-date chaos? Unclear. But I have to say, I was impressed. Bold
          move, sir.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came the car door moment. You actually opened it for me. Like, full-on gentleman mode activated. We went
          off on our little milkshake mission to the sea. No plans. No schedule. Just the shakes, and two dangerously
          good-looking humans. We got to the marina, found a quiet bench, and just sat down like we’d done it a hundred
          times before. It didn’t feel like two strangers getting to know each other. It felt like two souls going, “Oh
          hey, there you are.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We talked and laughed and vibed like we were already in sync, like we’d met before in another life and had
          just picked up where we left off. And when we started walking around with zero direction, just letting the
          evening take us wherever… it wasn’t awkward. It was perfect. Effortless. Like the world paused a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          You were calm. Sweet. Confident in that quiet way. And way, way too good at making me feel safe. It was almost
          suspicious. Honestly, are you a wizard?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hours later, we decided to head back to the car so I could grab my jumper (yes, I was cold, yes, I pretended I
          wasn’t freezing just to look cute). We got there and guess what? The car was still running.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes. The engine had been on the entire time. Just sitting there, humming politely, waiting to be stolen. You
          looked at the car, completely calm, then turned your head and, without even looking me in the eye, just said:
          <br><strong>“I was distracted by your beauty.”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sir. Please. I’m still recovering.
        </p>
        <p>
          You didn’t even try to be smooth, you just blamed me for your almost-stolen car like it was my fault for
          showing up too pretty. I wanted to roll my eyes and kiss you at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing dramatic really happened that night. Just a bench. A shake. A weirdly warm evening.<br>
          But it didn’t feel small. It felt like the kind of beginning people write songs about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, I didn’t want that evening to end.<br>
          But I already had this quiet little smile in the back of my mind… because I knew we were going out again in
          just a few hours.

        <h2>🗺️ Date 2: Dead Sea Detour</h2>
        <p>
          Some couples go on chill second dates.<br>
          We? We accidentally signed up for <em>The Amazing Race: Israel Edition</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          First mission: reach מצפה ים המלח. Simple, right?<br>
          Except… Waze had other plans.<br>
          It took us on a “scenic route” — through every tiny village in the area, including ones with big red signs
          saying <em>“No entry for Israelis.”</em><br>
          Fun! Cute! Slightly terrifying!
        </p>
        <p>
          I was quietly panicking, trying not to show it.<br>
          You? Just chilling. Like we weren’t one wrong turn away from being on the evening news.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we reached the “lookout.”<br>
          Spoiler: no sea. No view. Just a sleepy little yeshuv, a lot of dust, and a growing feeling of “Wait… where
          <em>are</em> we?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, we laughed. Took a breath. Then decided to try מצדה.<br>
          You were excited. I was hopeful. It was going to be beautiful, romantic, epic!<br>
          But… it was closed. Like, locked-gate, no-entry closed.<br>
          We just looked at each other like, <em>of course it is.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          After hours (and hours) of driving, we finally made it to the actual Dead Sea.<br>
          We walked. We talked. We stumbled into someone’s proposal (no, I didn’t say yes — but only because you didn’t
          ask 😉).
        </p>
        <p>
          There was something about that moment — unexpected, quiet, a little weird — that just felt… right.
        </p>
        <p>
          I taught you how to play the Wordle (forever changing your life, you're welcome).<br>
          You tried to take me to your favorite place in מחנה יהודה, but parking said “Not today.”<br>
          So we rerouted (again) and ended up at החברים in סינמה סיטי.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing went as planned.<br>
          Everything felt perfect anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it wasn’t about the places.<br>
          It was about <em>you</em>.<br>
          Your calm energy. Your easy smile.<br>
          The way you looked at me like we were exactly where we were meant to be — even if we had no idea where that
          was.
        </p>
        <p>
          That date? It was a mess.<br>
          A beautiful, funny, wild little mess.<br>
          And honestly… I loved every second.

        <h2>🧩 Date 3: The One With the Escape Room and Zero Beach</h2>
        <p>
          It started simple. Just a walk. Nothing fancy. No big expectations.<br>
          We strolled for a bit, then found a bench — romantic in theory, facing a very unromantic building in reality.
          (10/10 view of concrete. Still cute though. Because you were next to me.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the kind of walk where everything around you fades out a little. Where your brain finally shuts up,
          your heart leans in, and a tiny voice whispers, “Wait… this might actually be something real.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I honestly don’t remember exactly what we talked about. But I remember how it felt: Safe. Easy. Like I could
          finally breathe. (And also like, “Oh no. I might be in trouble. The good kind.”)
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came the escape room. We even started in separate rooms — two computers, no instructions, and a whole lot
          of "ummm?"<br>
          You had to figure out how to connect us. I had the code. You had the tools. (And I had a camera feed, where I
          was supposed to be solving puzzles… but instead I just kept watching you. Oops.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You were calm. Collected. Cool. (Annoyingly attractive, honestly.)<br>
          I… was on a different vibe. Somewhere between “hidden genius” and “frantic child with too much sugar.”<br>
          Still convinced we opened that final door. (Yes, the host helped. Yes, I’m ignoring that part.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Together we made an elite team: You = smooth spy energy. Me = chaotic puzzle goblin. Together = weirdly
          unstoppable. (Or just too stubborn to fail. Same thing.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came dinner at בארכה. The food was amazing. Like actually amazing. But you? You were glowing. (Like, can
          you not be that charming while I’m trying to chew?)
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, we planned to take a beach walk. We even drove to the beach. Parked and everything. But then… we
          just never got out of the car.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seats were comfy. The vibe was warm. It felt like the world got very still — like time decided to pause
          just for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          No beach. No sand. Just headlights off, windows up, two people sitting in a parked car… talking about
          everything and nothing at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We didn’t even notice how long we were there. We were just... in it. That little quiet bubble where nothing
          else mattered.<br>
          (Also, I downloaded a puzzle game on the car screen. For vibes. That counts as romantic, right?)
        </p>

        <h2>✈️ Date 4: The One With the Perfumes and the Airport</h2>
        <p>
          It was supposed to be simple.<br>
          One quiet morning before your flight.<br>
          Nothing big. Nothing dramatic.<br>
          (Just me, trying not to secretly cry inside a mall.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You picked me up early, calm as ever, like this was just another normal day.<br>
          We went to TLV Mall, grabbed breakfast, walked around slowly… like we had all the time in the world.<br>
          (We didn’t.)
        </p>
        <p>
          At one point, I casually mentioned I might get a perfume at duty-free. No big deal. Just a throwaway
          comment.<br>
          I didn’t even say which one — because obviously, you would copy me.<br>
          You promised you wouldn’t. You gave me that “trust me” look.<br>
          (So confident. So untrustworthy.)
        </p>
        <p>
          And then?<br>
          You totally did it.<br>
          But in the most ridiculous, sweet, over-the-top way possible.<br>
          Not one perfume. Not two.<br>
          <strong>Three.</strong><br>
          (Who does that?? Are you okay?? No, seriously.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I was honestly speechless.<br>
          You just smiled like, <em>“What, this? Just a small gesture.”</em><br>
          Meanwhile, I was trying not to melt into a perfume puddle.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, we walked a bit more, laughed, tried to ignore the ticking clock.<br>
          I was low-key panicking about your flight.<br>
          Not because I wanted you to leave (far from it) but because I knew how much was waiting for you back home.<br>
          I just wanted everything to go smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did have a confession to make,<br>
          I told you a friend was picking me up.<br>
          Because I knew if I told the truth — that I wanted to come with you to the airport — you’d say no.<br>
          You’d tell me "I don't want you to travel back yourself". You’d be all responsible and sweet.<br>
          (And I wasn’t in the mood for responsible.)
        </p>
        <p>
          But of course, you had your own plan.<br>
          “Let’s go sort your train first,” you said. So chill. So casual.<br>
          (Meanwhile, I was holding back tears and pretending to be cool.)
        </p>
        <p>
          We walked to the train.<br>
          I looked at you.<br>
          I said, “Okay, I saw it. Let’s go take <em>you</em> to the plane now.”<br>
          And you just nodded. No argument. No fuss. Just… yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was soft. Easy.<br>
          Like we were both trying to hold on a little longer — without saying it out loud.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we finally reached the last hug…<br>
          I snuck a small kiss on your cheek. Quick. Light.<br>
          (Like a secret. Like a “thank you.” Like a “don’t forget me.”)<br>
          I hoped you didn’t notice.<br>
          But also… I kind of really hoped you did.

        <h2>💌 After You Left</h2>
        <p><em>A.k.a. Two Weeks of Missing You, Loving You, and Planning Forever</em></p>

        <p>
          You left on a Wednesday.<br>
          And I told myself, “It’s fine. It’s only two weeks. I'll survive.”<br>
          (Lol.)
        </p>

        <p>
          By Friday, I came back from the gym all gross and sweaty…<br>
          and there was a man standing there.<br>
          Holding <strong>roses</strong>, <strong>chocolates</strong>, and a <strong>letter</strong>.<br>
          A real letter. With real feelings.
        </p>

        <p>
          My dad was there too — a little confused.<br>
          But within two minutes? He loved you already.<br>
          (You do that to people.)
        </p>

        <p>
          And me?<br>
          I just stood there, smiling like an idiot,<br>
          sniffing flowers I don’t even like<br>
          because they were from <em>you</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I read your letter once.<br>
          Then again.<br>
          Then again.<br>
          It hit me right in the heart.<br>
          You told me I live in your head rent-free —<br>
          but let’s be honest: <em>you’ve taken over mine</em>.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
          Since then, it’s been two weeks of nonstop texting, phone calls,<br>
          video calls,<br>
          “I miss you”s and “I love you”s and “Why aren’t you here already?”s.
        </p>

        <p>
          We talk about everything. We dream out loud.<br>
          And somewhere in all these hours…<br>
          you started feeling like <em>home</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          On May 25th, 5:16 PM UK time (yes, I also remember),<br>
          you said you want to put a ring on my finger.<br>
          No big speech. Just honesty.
        </p>

        <p>
          And in that second,<br>
          our future went from maybe…<br>
          to <strong><em>yes</em></strong>.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
          And now?<br>
          I came to <em>you</em>.<br>
          To meet your family.<br>
          To step into your world.<br>
          To go out together, hand in hand,<br>
          and show everyone what this love looks like in real life.
        </p>

        <p>
          (I hope they like me — but not too much, I’m still taking you back.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, it's your turn.<br>
          You’ll come to Israel.<br>
          Meet <em>my</em> family.<br>
          See where I come from.
        </p>

        <p>
          And somewhere between hummus and hugs…<br>
          you’ll ask <em>that</em> question.
        </p>

        <p>
          And me?<br>
          I’ve already got the answer.<br>
          (But you knew that.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Because this isn’t just a love story.<br>
          It’s <strong><em>our</em></strong> story.<br>
          And it’s just getting started.<br>
          💍❤️

                We were supposed to take a photo here,<br>
                but honestly? We got way too busy talking, laughing, and stealing little moments.<br>
                Sometimes, the best memories are the ones you don’t capture —<br>
                they’re the ones we feel, smile about, and replay in our heads.<br>
                And trust me, this moment was way too good to freeze in just one frame.

            And guess what?<br>
            I’m already daydreaming about all the new spots we’ll visit —<br>
            hand in hand, heart to heart, probably lost… but together.
