        <h1>🚗💕 Our Journey Begins</h1>
        <p>Well, look who just showed up…</p>
        <p>
          Mr. Prince Charming.<br>
          Mr. “How-Am-I-Supposed-To-Stay-Cool-When-You-Look-At-Me-Like-That.”<br>
          The guy who somehow makes my heart race <em>every</em> single time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to our special little place on the internet, made with love, a lot of happy memories, and
          maybe
          just a <em>tiny</em> bit of nervous excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t just a website. It’s our story, full of laughs, sweet surprises, and moments that made me
          fall
          (hard) for you.<br>
          Think of it like our own little movie.<br>
          No drama (unless we want to add it for fun). Just real, silly, sweet, heart-melting moments between
          two
          people who were clearly meant to meet.
        </p>
        <p>Inside, you’ll find:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flirty moments that made me smile like an idiot</li>
          <li>Memories I keep playing in my head</li>
          <li>And way too many cheesy compliments (get ready)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So scroll down and take a little trip back with me.
          Remember how it all started with one shake, one bench, and one crazy-strong feeling that something
          special was about to begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t just a story.<br>
          It’s a love note - just for you.
        </p>
        <p>And guess what?<br>You're the main character babe.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <h2>🥤 The One With the Shake & Sea</h2>
          <p>
            No pics, no proof, but trust me, we were dangerously cute. Like suspiciously adorable. We
            started with Rebar
            shakes. I carefully picked a flavour, put some thought into it… and you? You just looked at me,
            smiled, and
            said, “I’ll have the same.” No hesitation. No checking the menu. Just straight-up trust. Or
            laziness. Still
            not sure. British bravery or just classic first-date chaos? Unclear. But I have to say, I was
            impressed. Bold
            move, sir.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came the car door moment. You actually opened it for me. Like, full-on gentleman mode
            activated. We went
            off on our little milkshake mission to the sea. No plans. No schedule. Just the shakes, and two
            dangerously
            good-looking humans. We got to the marina, found a quiet bench, and just sat down like we’d done
            it a hundred
            times before. It didn’t feel like two strangers getting to know each other. It felt like two
            souls going, “Oh
            hey, there you are.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We talked and laughed and vibed like we were already in sync, like we’d met before in another
            life and had
            just picked up where we left off. And when we started walking around with zero direction, just
            letting the
            evening take us wherever… it wasn’t awkward. It was perfect. Effortless. Like the world paused a
            little.
          </p>
          <p>
            You were calm. Sweet. Confident in that quiet way. And way, way too good at making me feel safe.
            It was almost
            suspicious. Honestly, are you a wizard?
          </p>
          <p>
            Hours later, we decided to head back to the car so I could grab my jumper (yes, I was cold, yes,
            I pretended I
            wasn’t freezing just to look cute). We got there and guess what? The car was still running.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes. The engine had been on the entire time. Just sitting there, humming politely, waiting to be
            stolen. You
            looked at the car, completely calm, then turned your head and, without even looking me in the
            eye, just said:
            <br><strong>“I was distracted by your beauty.”</strong><br><br>
            Sir. Please. I’m still recovering.
          </p>
          <p>
            You didn’t even try to be smooth, you just blamed me for your almost-stolen car like it was my
            fault for
            showing up too pretty. I wanted to roll my eyes and kiss you at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing dramatic really happened that night. Just a bench. A shake. A weirdly warm evening.<br>
            But it didn’t feel small. It felt like the kind of beginning people write songs about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly, I didn’t want that evening to end.<br>
            But I already had this quiet little smile in the back of my mind… because I knew we were going
            out again in
            just a few hours.
          </p>

        <div class="content">
          <h2>🗺️ The One With the Dead Sea Detour</h2>
          <p>
            Some couples go on chill second dates.<br>
            We? We accidentally signed up for <em>The Amazing Race: Israel Edition</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First mission: reach מצפה ים המלח. Simple, right?
            Except… Waze had other plans.
            It took us on a “scenic route” through every tiny village in the area, including ones with big
            red signs
            saying <em>“No entry for Israelis.”</em><br>
            Fun! Cute! Slightly terrifying!
            I was quietly panicking, trying not to show it.
            You? Just chilling. Like we weren’t one wrong turn away from being on the evening news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we reached the “lookout.”<br>
            which turned out to be a sleepy little yeshuv with no sea in sight, minimal vibes, and just the
            right amount
            of “should we even
            <em>be </em> here?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, we laughed. Took a breath. Then decided to try מצדה.
            You were excited. I was hopeful. It was going to be beautiful, romantic, epic!
            But… it was closed. Like, locked-gate, no-entry closed.
            We just looked at each other like, <em>of course it is.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            After hours (and hours) of driving, we finally made it to the actual Dead Sea.
            We walked. We talked. We stumbled into someone’s proposal (no, I didn’t say yes, but only
            because you didn’t
            ask 😉).
            There was something about that moment - unexpected, quiet, a little weird, that just felt…
            right.
          </p>
          <p>
            I taught you how to play the Wordle (forever changing your life, you're welcome).<br>
            You tried to take me to your favorite place in מחנה יהודה, but parking said “Not today.”
            So we rerouted (again) and ended up at החברים in Cinema city.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing went as planned.<br>
            Everything felt perfect anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            That date? It was a mess.<br>
            A beautiful, funny, wild little mess.<br>
            And honestly… I loved every second.
          </p>

        <div class="content">
          <h2>🧩 The One With the Escape Room and Zero Beach</h2>
          <p>
            It started simple. Just a walk. Nothing fancy. No big expectations.<br>
            We strolled for a bit, then found a bench - romantic in theory, facing a very unromantic
            building in reality.
            (10/10 view of concrete. Still cute though. Because you were next to me.)
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the kind of walk where everything around you fades out a little. Where your brain finally
            shuts up,
            your heart leans in, and a tiny voice whispers, “Wait… this might actually be something real.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I honestly don’t remember exactly what we talked about. But I remember how it felt: Safe. Easy.
            Like I could
            finally breathe. (And also like, “Oh no. I might be in trouble. The good kind.”)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came the escape room. We started in separate rooms - two computers, no instructions, and a
            whole lot
            of "ummm?"<br>
            You had to figure out how to connect us. I had the code. (And I also had a camera feed, where I
            was supposed to be solving the code, but instead I just kept watching you. Oops.)
          </p>
          <p>
            You were calm. Collected. Cool. (Annoyingly attractive, honestly.)<br>
            I… was on a different vibe. Somewhere between “hidden genius” and “frantic child with too much
            sugar.”<br>
            Still convinced we opened that final door. (Yes, the host helped. Yes, I’m ignoring that part.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came dinner at בארכה. The food was amazing. Like actually amazing. But you? You were
            glowing. (Like, can
            you not be that charming while I’m trying to chew?)
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, we planned to take a beach walk. We even drove to the beach. Parked and everything.
            But then… we
            just never got out of the car.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seats were comfy. The vibe was warm. It felt like the world got very still, like time
            decided to pause
            just for us.
          </p>
          <p>
            No beach. No sand. Just headlights off, windows up, two people sitting in a parked car… talking
            about
            everything and nothing at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We didn’t even notice how long we were there. We were just... in it. That little quiet bubble
            where nothing
            else mattered.<br>
            (Also, I downloaded a puzzle game on the car screen. For vibes. That counts as romantic, right?)

          <h2>✈️ The One With the Perfumes and the Airport</h2>
          <p>
            It was supposed to be simple.
            One quiet morning before your flight.
            Nothing big. Nothing dramatic.
            (Just me, trying not to secretly cry inside a mall.)
          </p>
          <p>
            You picked me up early, calm as ever, like this was just another normal day.
            We went to TLV Mall, grabbed breakfast, walked around slowly… like we had all the time in the
            world.
            (We didn’t)
          </p>
          <p>
            At one point, I casually mentioned I might get a perfume at duty-free. No big deal. Just a
            throwaway
            comment.
            but obviously didn’t tell you which one. Because duh? You’d 100% steal my idea.
            You promised you wouldn’t. You gave me that “trust me” look.<br>
            (So confident. So untrustworthy.)
          </p>
          <p>
            And then?
            You totally did it.
            But in the most ridiculous, sweet, over-the-top way possible.
            Not one perfume. Not two.<br>
            <strong>Three.</strong><br>
            (Who does that?? Are you okay?? No, seriously.)
          </p>
          <p>
            I was honestly speechless.
            You just smiled and said something like, <em>“I just don’t want you to forget me”</em>
            (As if that could ever happen.)
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, we walked a bit more, laughed, tried to ignore the ticking clock.
            I was low-key panicking about your flight.
            Not because I wanted you to leave (far from it) but because I knew how much was waiting for you
            back home.
            I just wanted everything to go smoothly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did have a confession to make,
            I told you a friend was picking me up.
            Because I knew if I told the truth that I wanted to come with you to the airport, you’d say no.
            You’d tell me "I don't want you to travel back yourself". You’d be all responsible and sweet.
            (And I wasn’t in the mood for responsible.)
          </p>
          <p>
            But of course, you had your own plan.
            “Let’s go sort your train first,” you said. So chill. So casual.
            (Meanwhile, I was holding back tears and pretending to be cool.)
            We walked to the train.
            I looked at you.
            I said, “Okay, I saw it. Let’s go take <em>you</em> to the plane now.”
            And you just nodded. No argument. No fuss. Just… yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was soft. Easy.<br>
            Like we were both trying to hold on a little longer without saying it out loud.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we finally reached the last hug…
            I snuck a small kiss on your cheek. Quick. Light.
            (Like a secret. Like a “thank you.” Like a “don’t forget me.”)
            I hoped you didn’t notice.
            But also… I kind of really hoped you did.
          </p>

          <p><em>💌 A.k.a. Two Weeks of Missing You, Smiling Like a Fool, and Falling Even Deeper</em></p>

          <p>
            You left on a Wednesday.<br>
            And I told myself, “It’s fine. It’s only two weeks. I’ll be fine.”<br>
            (LOL)
          </p>

          <p>
            By Friday, I came home from the gym all gross and sweaty…
            and there was a surprise waiting for me:
            <strong>Red roses</strong>, <strong>chocolates</strong>, and a <strong>letter</strong>.
            A real one. With your heart poured into every word.
          </p>

          <p>
            My dad stood there, lowkey confused…<br>
            but give him two minutes, and boom - he was team you.
            (You have that effect.)
          </p>

          <p>
            And me?<br>
            I stood there smiling like a fool,
            sniffing flowers I don’t even like,
            just because they were from <em>you</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I read your letter once.<br>
            Then again.<br>
            And again.<br>
            You told me I live in your head rent-free<br>
            but honestly? <em>You’ve fully moved into mine</em>.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>
            Then came Shavuot. I wasn’t expecting anything…
            but then another surprise:
            <strong>Lilies</strong> (my mums favorite, how did you know?),
            more <strong>chocolate</strong>,
            and that same soft feeling of being loved across miles.
          </p>

          <p>
            It has been two weeks of:
            texts, calls, videos, “I miss you”s,
            and “Why aren’t you here already?”s.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every morning begins with Wordle like it’s a love language.
            (You are already better than me, This is a little embarrassing for me honestly)
            And somehow, even a little green square makes me smile,
            because it’s something <em>we</em> do. Together.
          </p>

          <p>
            We talk. We laugh. We plan. We dream.<br>
            And somewhere in those long conversations,
            you started feeling like <em>home</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t just a long-distance thing.<br>
            It’s a you-and-me thing.<br>
            And it’s only getting better.

            It had been <em>years</em> since I last traveled, and I’d clearly forgotten how exhausting it could be. No
            sleep. No proper food. No clue what I was doing.
            By the time I landed in London, I was completely overwhelmed… but then I saw you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You were standing there with that look that flips my stomach, holding burgers and drinks like a movie hero.
            You handed Akiva the food first, classic you. And then we finally hugged, for real, after all that waiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            That burger? Exactly what I needed. The drinks? Kinda terrible. But the effort? 100/10.
          </p>
          <p>
            You made me feel seen, loved, beautiful, despite how exhausted I was. And you welcomed Akiva so naturally,
            like he’d always belonged there. Like <em>we</em> did.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you left, I gave you the little gift I’d been holding onto: a keychain with a QR code, leading to our
            story. My hands were shaking, not just from tiredness, but because it meant something. And so do you.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was only a few hours, but you turned it into a whole movie in my heart.
            I left the airport with a full heart (and a still-half-eaten burger), counting the seconds until I’d see you
            again.

            Sunday came, and with it, you. Calm, cool, collected. Picking us up like it was just another day (but to me,
            it was everything).
          </p>
          <p>
            You gave us the best kind of tour: personal, funny, filled with stories. Then we landed at <strong>Aviv
              Restaurant</strong> (because obviously you know the manager 🙄). We ordered food like royalty and ate
            like birds, classic us.
          </p>
          <p>
            That night you waited patiently while we got ready. You never complain. You just show up. Always.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then? One of my favorite nights ever. The glow of <strong>Chinatown</strong> nd the quiet sparkle
            of <strong>Tower Bridge</strong>, it felt like our own rom-com. We finally got a photo (thank you Akiva),
            but the moment I remember most? Sitting with you by the bridge, everything quiet. Just you, me, and a
            heartbeat that wouldn’t slow down.
          </p>
          <p>
            We almost kissed. The scene was perfect, until Akiva turned around 😅. Still love him. Still a mood-killer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the ride back felt like floating. Because when I’m with you… everything does.

          <h2>💋 The One With the First Kiss</h2>
          <p>
            You picked us up way too early (like, criminally early), but somehow, I was excited anyway. We started at
            <strong>Buckingham Palace</strong> – all royal and fancy – and took more pictures (thank you again, Akiva,
            our loyal photo soldier).
          </p>
          <p>
            We saw the King’s horse guards, walked around like total tourists, and tried <strong>Starbucks</strong> for
            the first time… which, let’s be real, was mid at best.
          </p>
          <p>
            We did <strong>25k steps</strong> that day – more than a marathon (someone give us a medal or a foot
            massage).
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came the iconic <strong>London Eye</strong>, more views, more awkward-but-adorable photos, more stolen
            glances. But THEN came the <strong>Dungeon</strong>. I had no clue what I was signing up for.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought it was some museum-y thing. It was NOT. It was terror. Real, theatrical, scream-like-a-baby
            horror. I was absolutely terrified. Like, cried terrified. You? Held me the entire time like it was nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            You and Akiva just kept laughing while I practically climbed up your body trying to escape. (Not dramatic.
            Just factual.)
          </p>
          <p>
            After the Dungeon, we tried to get back to the car – key word: <em>tried</em>. Thanks to my elite (read:
            tragic) navigation skills – and Akiva’s request to ride a red double-decker – we took the bus for literally
            one stop… then ended up walking another 40 minutes. Why you both still trusted me? Mystery.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that trauma bonding session, we took Akiva to the airport. Funny enough, you two were the emotional
            ones. You hugged like brothers, and I just stood there, trying not to cry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came something sweeter: <strong>pizza</strong>. Because of me, you tried it for the first time ever.
            Okay, it was only the crust, but hey, that counts. I was weirdly proud of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we got in the car. Stole some more glances. Quiet. Soft. The kind of silence that feels warm, not
            awkward.
          </p>
          <p>
            And in the middle of that quiet? I told you, “Just kiss me already.” And you did. Finally. I lost a contact
            lens (talented, I know).
          </p>
          <p>
            Later that night, you took me to your go-to spot – somewhere between <strong>Golders Green</strong> and
            <strong>Stamford Hill</strong> – a hidden place where you can see the whole of London. The city sparkled.
            You held me. We kissed. You literally carried me down the hill like a baby. And then you dropped me off,
            gentle and sweet as always.

        <button class="collapsible">Date 8: The Safari</button>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>🦁 The One With the Safari</h2>
          <p>
            You picked me up a little late today… (yes, I was bored all morning, thank you for asking). But the second I
            saw you, all the waiting melted away. (worth it every time)
          </p>
          <p>
            We stopped at <strong>Golders Green bakery</strong> for breakfast - yummy bread, good smoothies, warm vibes,
            and you by my side (better than any 5-star restaurant).
          </p>
          <p>
            Then: <strong>Safari time!</strong> I was petrified, obviously - the lions, the wolves, the bears?? WHY are
            they looking at me like I’m on the menu?! But you were calm and smiley and sweet the whole time. (You're my
            brave king, I’m just the sidekick screaming in the car window)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then… THE <strong>BOAT RIDE</strong>. A little lake, a tiny green pedal boat - not the pink one I wanted
            (rude) but it was so so cute anyway. We pedaled and giggled and acted like the cheesiest couple in every
            romcom ever. (I loved every second of it don’t judge)
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, we went straight to the <strong>kids' play area</strong> (yes we’re grown, no we don’t care). We
            climbed, we swung, we laughed like little kids again.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ended up chilling on one of the playground things just vibing… until a staff member was like: “Uhhh we’re
            closing now.” Oops 😅
          </p>
          <p>
            We walked out slowly, saw some adorable <strong>sea lions</strong>, and then sat down for a snack. Me and my
            salad. You and your sweet face (and your fake sausage roll). We didn’t even notice the time until a car
            passed by and told us the safari closed… half an hour ago. (Time really flies when you’re with someone that
            makes your heart feel full.)
          </p>
          <p>
            THEN: <strong>Movie time</strong>. We went to watch <strong>Ballerina</strong>, it was sweet… until someone
            (👀) started snoozing before the ending. (But it's fine I'll forgive you, very mature of me. I know)
          </p>
          <p>
            But after the movie, my head started hurting so bad, I couldn’t even move. And I hit it on the car door on
            the way in. You were SO kind. Took me to get medicine, kept checking if I was okay. Your face was full of
            concern, and honestly… it made me feel so loved. (10/10 husband energy)
          </p>
          <p>
            When we got back, I passed out a bit in the car… and woke up with a jolt outside the place I’m staying. You
            were still sitting there, just quietly making sure I was okay. (my heart actually melted)
          </p>
          <p>
            We stayed in the car talking until <strong>sunrise at 4AM</strong>. We talked about the future. About
            <em>us</em>. Marriage, proposals, dreams, everything. (yes, I almost cried)
          </p>
          <p>
            Also very important: you saw my little food-baby belly pop out and I loved it. Second most important thing:
            I sat in the weirdest positions like I totally trusted you. (which I do. Completely.)
          </p>

          <p>
            You picked me up at 1PM (yep… late again! but it’s okay, you’re cute so I forgave you fast).
          </p>
          <p>
            First stop – the <strong>post office</strong> to send my dad’s passport. You were more on top of it than I
            was! (Seriously, I think you cared about it more than me.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we went to this <strong>HUGE mall</strong> – like, giant. We barely made it into 3 shops because each
            one was like its own city. But I got two adorable jumpers and of course… you didn’t let me pay (at this
            point I didn't even bother asking anymore).
          </p>
          <p>
            We went to <strong>M&S</strong> next and loaded a full mountain of clothes for you to try. We were so ready,
            like professional stylists or something. But the dressing room lady crushed our dreams: “You can only try 8
            items,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we stood there like two sad kids picking the top clothes (’cause tbh we were so finished for the day).
            You tried on the 8 and only liked one shirt. And then… the lady put all the other stuff back without even
            asking 😩 (I wanted to cry a little - we worked so hard picking those!)
          </p>
          <p>
            You were totally done after that. (No more clothes! “Retired from fashion.”)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I had to hop on a <strong>Zoom call</strong>, so we stayed in the car. And you were secretly happy
            about that (no more trying trousers!)
          </p>
          <p>
            Next stop: <strong>Mazal!</strong> We went for dinner and I made you try chumus for the first time ever! You
            said you liked it… (but hmm… you didn’t really go back for seconds without me, mister 😏)
          </p>
          <p>
            I had my classic hamburger (of course), and you had plain shawarma.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then it was time for <strong>arcade games and bowling!</strong> I crushed it. I won. Everything. (Almost.)
            You said you let me win to make me feel good… but we both know the truth. (Queen of Bowling right here 👑)
          </p>
          <p>
            After all the fun, we took a <strong>long walk by the river</strong> - soft lights, peaceful water, you and
            me. We made out a little (just a tiny bit) because I’m just so crazy about you.
          </p>

            On the way home we stopped at a <strong>gas station</strong>, grabbed chocolate and pads (true love level
            unlocked). A real British lady looked at us and called us “pussys.” (Ah yes. The UK, where love meets sass.)

          <h2>🍸 The One With the French Kiss Cocktail</h2>
          <p>
            You picked me up around 12PM (better than last time 👏), but I wasn’t really in the mood to eat anything
            (shocking, I know).
          </p>
          <p>
            We started off at a different mall this time (even though, let’s be honest… they all kinda look the same,
            I'm still sure you scammed me into taking me to the same place every time).
          </p>
          <p>
            We went to get my mother her <strong>b-e-e-are</strong> (don’t make me say it, my mother would kill me).
            Then we walked around a bit more and grabbed some presents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither of us wanted to try on more clothes again (our fashion adventure from last time still had us
            traumatized).
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, we went back to <strong>Golders Green</strong>, straight to Kosher Kingdom. And right outside, 2
            random people wanted to interview us about Israel because we looked too good. (We looked like jetlag and
            snacks but okay, sure.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the store, we shopped like a real married couple. <em>Married Mode: Activated</em>. We got stuff for
            my mom, my precious pickles, and a load of nash and junk food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, I really needed the bathroom so you took me to another mall (yes, the third different/same mall… but
            who's counting?)
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came the big part… <strong>I met your family.</strong> I had been waiting so long for that moment but I
            was SO nervous. We stopped for flowers and cake - came prepared like always.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then... we walked in. And guess what? It wasn’t awkward for even a second. Your family is the sweetest -
            your sisters, your brother, your parents. (Yair is my fav but don’t be jealous 👀)
          </p>
          <p>
            Your mom? A legend. I tried homemade lachuch for the first time and wow - I’d eat that every single day if
            she let me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made a mess eating a cookie (classic), left behind DNA-level crumbs, and your house is so clean I was sure
            they’d see my hair on the floor. 😂
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, we tried going to that bar you love, but it was booked. So we found a cute little spot nearby
            instead. I ordered a cocktail called “French Kiss” - it had a tongue sticking out (concerning). The drink
            was horrible, but you were beside me so I was happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I fell asleep at some point (PAYBACK for you at the movie), apparently for like an hour. Somewhere in there,
            we booked one-way flights to Israel. And THEN... Israel announced war with Iran. 😬
          </p>
          <p>
            You were glued to the news, I was panic-texting. Classic us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back in the car, we made out again (yes, you saw my boobs, I said it 😂). I got my very first hickey - thank
            you, sir. Then… you let me drive your car.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was doing okay... until I hit the pavement. Still counts as decent driving. Finally made it to my place -
            at 4:30 AM. And guess what? Locked. Out. So we had to wake up my brother.
          </p>

          <h2>💐 The One With Your Mum's Fish</h2>
          <p>
            You picked me up late again (not surprised anymore - it’s just your style now).
          </p>
          <p>
            I needed to buy some things before Shabbat, so we went shopping again. (We’re basically a married couple
            already - always in stores buying random stuff together.)
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, we stopped at your parents’ house. I wasn’t expecting anything, but suddenly there was this
            amazing <strong>Moroccan fish</strong> and fresh bread on the table!
          </p>
          <p>
            (Seriously, since when can you eat spices?! I’m still in shock 😱) It was so tasty and cozy, I felt like a
            spoiled queen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your family was so sweet, taking care of me like I belong there. I loved every second of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we picked up some flowers for Sara. (Yes, it took us 3 stores to find them. Yes, we’re too classy to
            give up.)
          </p>
          <p>
            We went to her place, and you got <strong>stuck there</strong>. Like really stuck. Like “maybe you moved in”
            stuck 😅
          </p>
          <p>
            But then your mom called to say people were already at your house to daven. Still, you didn’t want to leave
            me alone too long.
          </p>
          <p>
            ("I know I'm not a whole shul, but I’m still your favorite person to pray for, right?" 😇)

          <h2>🌸 The One With the Little Meltdown</h2>
          <p>
            You said you’d arrive at Sara’s at 12PM. You even joked about how they talk too much and their food’s
            terrible (👀 rude). But... it was actually really good.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 11:57AM we heard a knock and I was like, “No way that’s you.” Of course, I was right. You showed up at
            2:30PM. ("Some things never change… like you being fashionably 2.5 hours late.")
          </p>
          <p>
            We chatted with Sara and Shira - both approved of you big time. (Even though technically they needed to
            approve me. But let’s be real, I was their favorite.)
          </p>
          <p>
            We left and walked toward your place. It was a long walk but felt short because it was with you (cheese
            level 9000 🧀). People definitely stared - too hot to ignore.
          </p>
          <p>
            We got to your place and I was craving privacy. So we went to that park nearby - had a stroll, a kiss, and a
            quiet moment together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we walked back for <strong>Seuda Shlishit</strong> - your mum nailed it again. ("Is there a food fairy
            living in your kitchen??")
          </p>
          <p>
            The food was amazing. Your family was even better. And yes, <strong>Yair</strong> took better care of me
            than you did (rude, but true).
          </p>
          <p>
            After Shabbat, we went back to Sara’s for my stuff. (Shockingly, you didn’t get stuck this time! Growth!)
          </p>
          <p>
            We were headed to <strong>Chinatown</strong>… but I had a little meltdown (homesick moment 😢).
          </p>
          <p>
            You told me not to write too much, but you were so sweet. You stopped the car, hugged me tight, held me like
            I was made of glass, and made me feel completely safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            We didn’t make it to Chinatown - but honestly, I didn’t care. Because sitting with you, even tear-streaked
            and puffy-eyed, was better than any night out.
          </p>
