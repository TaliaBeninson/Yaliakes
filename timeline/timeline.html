          <h1>🚗💕 Our Journey Begins</h1>
          <p>Well, look who just showed up…</p>
          <p>
            Mr. Prince Charming.<br>
            Mr. “How-Am-I-Supposed-To-Stay-Cool-When-You-Look-At-Me-Like-That.”<br>
            The guy who somehow makes my heart race <em>every</em> single time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome to our special little place on the internet, made with love, a lot of happy memories, and maybe
            just a <em>tiny</em> bit of nervous excitement.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t just a website. It’s our story, full of laughs, sweet surprises, and moments that made me fall
            (hard) for you.<br>
            Think of it like our own little movie.<br>
            No drama (unless we want to add it for fun). Just real, silly, sweet, heart-melting moments between two
            people who were clearly meant to meet.
          </p>
          <p>Inside, you’ll find:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flirty moments that made me smile like an idiot</li>
            <li>Memories I keep playing in my head</li>
            <li>And way too many cheesy compliments (get ready)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So scroll down and take a little trip back with me.
            Remember how it all started with one shake, one bench, and one crazy-strong feeling that something
            special was about to begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t just a story.<br>
            It’s a love note - just for you.
          </p>
          <p>And guess what?<br>You're the main character babe.</p>

      <h2>🥤 Date 1: The One With the Shake & Sea</h2>
      <p>
        No pics, no proof, but trust me, we were dangerously cute. Like suspiciously adorable. We started with Rebar
        shakes. I carefully picked a flavour, put some thought into it… and you? You just looked at me, smiled, and
        said, “I’ll have the same.” No hesitation. No checking the menu. Just straight-up trust. Or laziness. Still
        not sure. British bravery or just classic first-date chaos? Unclear. But I have to say, I was impressed. Bold
        move, sir.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came the car door moment. You actually opened it for me. Like, full-on gentleman mode activated. We went
        off on our little milkshake mission to the sea. No plans. No schedule. Just the shakes, and two dangerously
        good-looking humans. We got to the marina, found a quiet bench, and just sat down like we’d done it a hundred
        times before. It didn’t feel like two strangers getting to know each other. It felt like two souls going, “Oh
        hey, there you are.”
      </p>
      <p>
        We talked and laughed and vibed like we were already in sync, like we’d met before in another life and had
        just picked up where we left off. And when we started walking around with zero direction, just letting the
        evening take us wherever… it wasn’t awkward. It was perfect. Effortless. Like the world paused a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        You were calm. Sweet. Confident in that quiet way. And way, way too good at making me feel safe. It was almost
        suspicious. Honestly, are you a wizard?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hours later, we decided to head back to the car so I could grab my jumper (yes, I was cold, yes, I pretended I
        wasn’t freezing just to look cute). We got there and guess what? The car was still running.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. The engine had been on the entire time. Just sitting there, humming politely, waiting to be stolen. You
        looked at the car, completely calm, then turned your head and, without even looking me in the eye, just said:
        <br><strong>“I was distracted by your beauty.”</strong><br><br>
        Sir. Please. I’m still recovering.
      </p>
      <p>
        You didn’t even try to be smooth, you just blamed me for your almost-stolen car like it was my fault for
        showing up too pretty. I wanted to roll my eyes and kiss you at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing dramatic really happened that night. Just a bench. A shake. A weirdly warm evening.<br>
        But it didn’t feel small. It felt like the kind of beginning people write songs about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, I didn’t want that evening to end.<br>
        But I already had this quiet little smile in the back of my mind… because I knew we were going out again in
        just a few hours.

      <h2>🗺️ Date 2: The One With the Dead Sea Detour</h2>
      <p>
        Some couples go on chill second dates.<br>
        We? We accidentally signed up for <em>The Amazing Race: Israel Edition</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        First mission: reach מצפה ים המלח. Simple, right?
        Except… Waze had other plans.
        It took us on a “scenic route” through every tiny village in the area, including ones with big red signs
        saying <em>“No entry for Israelis.”</em><br>
        Fun! Cute! Slightly terrifying!
        I was quietly panicking, trying not to show it.
        You? Just chilling. Like we weren’t one wrong turn away from being on the evening news.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we reached the “lookout.”<br>
        which turned out to be a sleepy little yeshuv with no sea in sight, minimal vibes, and just the right amount
        of “should we even
        <em>be </em> here?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, we laughed. Took a breath. Then decided to try מצדה.
        You were excited. I was hopeful. It was going to be beautiful, romantic, epic!
        But… it was closed. Like, locked-gate, no-entry closed.
        We just looked at each other like, <em>of course it is.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After hours (and hours) of driving, we finally made it to the actual Dead Sea.
        We walked. We talked. We stumbled into someone’s proposal (no, I didn’t say yes, but only because you didn’t
        ask 😉).
        There was something about that moment - unexpected, quiet, a little weird, that just felt… right.
      </p>
      <p>
        I taught you how to play the Wordle (forever changing your life, you're welcome).<br>
        You tried to take me to your favorite place in מחנה יהודה, but parking said “Not today.”
        So we rerouted (again) and ended up at החברים in Cinema city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing went as planned.<br>
        Everything felt perfect anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        That date? It was a mess.<br>
        A beautiful, funny, wild little mess.<br>
        And honestly… I loved every second.
      </p>

      <h2>🧩 Date 3: The One With the Escape Room and Zero Beach</h2>
      <p>
        It started simple. Just a walk. Nothing fancy. No big expectations.<br>
        We strolled for a bit, then found a bench - romantic in theory, facing a very unromantic building in reality.
        (10/10 view of concrete. Still cute though. Because you were next to me.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the kind of walk where everything around you fades out a little. Where your brain finally shuts up,
        your heart leans in, and a tiny voice whispers, “Wait… this might actually be something real.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I honestly don’t remember exactly what we talked about. But I remember how it felt: Safe. Easy. Like I could
        finally breathe. (And also like, “Oh no. I might be in trouble. The good kind.”)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came the escape room. We started in separate rooms - two computers, no instructions, and a whole lot
        of "ummm?"<br>
        You had to figure out how to connect us. I had the code. (And I also had a camera feed, where I
        was supposed to be solving the code, but instead I just kept watching you. Oops.)
      </p>
      <p>
        You were calm. Collected. Cool. (Annoyingly attractive, honestly.)<br>
        I… was on a different vibe. Somewhere between “hidden genius” and “frantic child with too much sugar.”<br>
        Still convinced we opened that final door. (Yes, the host helped. Yes, I’m ignoring that part.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came dinner at בארכה. The food was amazing. Like actually amazing. But you? You were glowing. (Like, can
        you not be that charming while I’m trying to chew?)
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, we planned to take a beach walk. We even drove to the beach. Parked and everything. But then… we
        just never got out of the car.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seats were comfy. The vibe was warm. It felt like the world got very still, like time decided to pause
        just for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        No beach. No sand. Just headlights off, windows up, two people sitting in a parked car… talking about
        everything and nothing at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We didn’t even notice how long we were there. We were just... in it. That little quiet bubble where nothing
        else mattered.<br>
        (Also, I downloaded a puzzle game on the car screen. For vibes. That counts as romantic, right?)

      <h2>✈️ Date 4: The One With the Perfumes and the Airport</h2>
      <p>
        It was supposed to be simple.
        One quiet morning before your flight.
        Nothing big. Nothing dramatic.
        (Just me, trying not to secretly cry inside a mall.)
      </p>
      <p>
        You picked me up early, calm as ever, like this was just another normal day.
        We went to TLV Mall, grabbed breakfast, walked around slowly… like we had all the time in the world.
        (We didn’t)
      </p>
      <p>
        At one point, I casually mentioned I might get a perfume at duty-free. No big deal. Just a throwaway
        comment.
        but obviously didn’t tell you which one. Because duh? You’d 100% steal my idea.
        You promised you wouldn’t. You gave me that “trust me” look.<br>
        (So confident. So untrustworthy.)
      </p>
      <p>
        And then?
        You totally did it.
        But in the most ridiculous, sweet, over-the-top way possible.
        Not one perfume. Not two.<br>
        <strong>Three.</strong><br>
        (Who does that?? Are you okay?? No, seriously.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I was honestly speechless.  
        You just smiled and said something like, <em>“I just don’t want you to forget me”</em>  
        (As if that could ever happen.)  
      </p>      
      <p>
        After that, we walked a bit more, laughed, tried to ignore the ticking clock.
        I was low-key panicking about your flight.
        Not because I wanted you to leave (far from it) but because I knew how much was waiting for you back home.
        I just wanted everything to go smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did have a confession to make,
        I told you a friend was picking me up.
        Because I knew if I told the truth that I wanted to come with you to the airport, you’d say no.
        You’d tell me "I don't want you to travel back yourself". You’d be all responsible and sweet.
        (And I wasn’t in the mood for responsible.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But of course, you had your own plan.
        “Let’s go sort your train first,” you said. So chill. So casual.
        (Meanwhile, I was holding back tears and pretending to be cool.)
        We walked to the train.
        I looked at you.
        I said, “Okay, I saw it. Let’s go take <em>you</em> to the plane now.”
        And you just nodded. No argument. No fuss. Just… yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was soft. Easy.<br>
        Like we were both trying to hold on a little longer without saying it out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we finally reached the last hug…
        I snuck a small kiss on your cheek. Quick. Light.
        (Like a secret. Like a “thank you.” Like a “don’t forget me.”)
        I hoped you didn’t notice.
        But also… I kind of really hoped you did.

      <h2>💌 After You Left</h2>
      <p><em>A.k.a. Two Weeks of Missing You, Smiling Like a Fool, and Falling Even Deeper</em></p>

      <p>
        You left on a Wednesday.<br>
        And I told myself, “It’s fine. It’s only two weeks. I’ll be fine.”<br>
        (LOL)
      </p>

      <p>
        By Friday, I came home from the gym all gross and sweaty…
        and there was a surprise waiting for me:
        <strong>Red roses</strong>, <strong>chocolates</strong>, and a <strong>letter</strong>.
        A real one. With your heart poured into every word.
      </p>

      <p>
        My dad stood there, lowkey confused…<br>
        but give him two minutes, and boom - he was team you.
        (You have that effect.)
      </p>

      <p>
        And me?<br>
        I stood there smiling like a fool,  
        sniffing flowers I don’t even like,
        just because they were from <em>you</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I read your letter once.<br>
        Then again.<br>
        And again.<br>
        You told me I live in your head rent-free<br>
        but honestly? <em>You’ve fully moved into mine</em>.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        Then came Shavuot. I wasn’t expecting anything…
        but then another surprise:
        <strong>Lilies</strong> (my mums favorite, how did you know?),
        more <strong>chocolate</strong>,
        and that same soft feeling of being loved across miles.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has been two weeks of:
        texts, calls, videos, “I miss you”s,
        and “Why aren’t you here already?”s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every morning begins with Wordle like it’s a love language.
        (You are already better than me, This is a little embarrassing for me honestly)
        And somehow, even a little green square makes me smile,
        because it’s something <em>we</em> do. Together.
      </p>

      <p>
        We talk. We laugh. We plan. We dream.<br>
        And somewhere in those long conversations,
        you started feeling like <em>home</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t just a long-distance thing.<br>
        It’s a you-and-me thing.<br>
        And it’s only getting better.
        ❤️🌍

          hand in hand, heart to heart, probably lost… but together.

        Just a little mix I made<br>
        songs that remind me of you, of us,<br>
        and all the moments I never want to forget.

        <h2>Hey, look who made it to the end 😏💘</h2>
        <p>
          But don’t get too cozy, this isn’t <em>“The End,”</em><br>
          This is just the next chapter in the best love story ever written - ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s still so much more waiting for us:<br>
          more walks we won’t want to end,<br>
          more late-night calls where we forget the time,<br>
          and more “how do you still make me blush?” moments (seriously, how?).
        </p>
        <p>
          I know there’ll be new places to explore, new memories to make,<br>
          and probably a few more surprises from you that leave me grinning like a total idiot.
        </p>
        <p>
          So yeah…<br>
          You’re stuck with me, Mr. Romantic.<br>
          <strong>Forever’s</strong> looking <em>real</em> cute on us.
