            <h1>🚗💕 Our Journey Begins</h1>
            <p>Hey look who’s here!</p>
            <p>
              Mr. Prince Charming, Mr. Way-Too-Handsome-For-My-Peace-of-Mind, and the one who somehow makes my heart
              race every single time. Welcome to our special place on the internet — made with love, a bit of nervous
              excitement, and a lot of happy memories.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is where I’m sharing our story — all the dates, laughs, awkward moments, and sweet surprises that
              made us… well, us. Think of this as our own little movie, without the drama (unless you want to add your
              own soundtrack).
            </p>
            <p>Inside, you’ll find:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Flirty moments that made me smile</li>
              <li>Memories that keep playing in my head</li>
              <li>And plenty of cheesy compliments (fair warning!)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So scroll down, take a trip back with me, and remember how it all started — with a little shake, a lot of
              laughs, and maybe a hint that something special was about to begin. This isn’t just a story. It’s a little
              love note, just for you.
            </p>
            <p><strong>And guess what?</strong><br> You’re the main character.</p>

        <h2>🥤 Date 1: Shake & Sea</h2>
        <p>
          No pics, no proof — but trust me, we were dangerously cute. We grabbed Rebar shakes — or rather, I picked one
          and you just said, “I’ll have the same,” like this was some kind of blind trust exercise. British bravery or
          first-date laziness? Unclear. Either way, bold move.
        </p>
        <p>
          We found a bench by the marina, kicked back, and talked like two people who’d known each other for years — or
          at least had done several lives together before this one. Then we wandered around with absolutely no plan in
          mind — just following the vibes (and maybe each other’s eyes a little too often). Honestly, it felt less like
          a date and more like a soft start to something big.
        </p>
        <p>
          You were calm, sweet, and way too good at making me feel safe. It was low-key suspicious. Are you a wizard?
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing wild happened — just a bench, a shake, and one very promising beginning.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Bonus Memory:</strong></p>
        <p>
          You opened the car doors for me (gentleman alert), we strolled off into our spontaneous sea-shake adventure…
          and hours later, came back just to grab a jacket — only to find the car still running. Like it had just been
          sitting there, humbly waiting to get stolen. You looked at it, then looked at me and just said, completely
          straight-faced, “I was distracted by your beauty.” (Sir, please. I'm still recovering.)
        </p>
        <p>
          (That line will be replayed in my brain forever, complete with dramatic wind and a background soundtrack.
          10/10. Oscar-worthy.)

        <h2>🗺️ Date 2: Dead Sea Detours</h2>
        <p>
          Some couples go on chill second dates. We accidentally auditioned for <em>The Amazing Race: Israel
            Edition</em>. First stop: מצפה ים המלח — which sounded like a great idea until Waze took us on a scenic tour
          through half the Arab villages in the region. Add in a few of those bright red “NO ENTRY for Israelis” signs
          and suddenly we were starring in a suspense movie with zero backup plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, we reached the overlook — which turned out to be a sleepy little yeshuv with no sea in sight,
          minimal vibes, and just the right amount of “should we even be here?” crisis. Then we put our hopes in מצדה,
          dreaming of historical grandeur… only to find it locked up for the day. We finally made it to the actual Dead
          Sea, took a walk, and casually stumbled into someone’s proposal. (No, I didn’t say yes. Tempting, though.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, I taught you Wordle (forever changing your life — you’re welcome). You tried to take me to your
          favorite spot in מחנה יהודה, but parking said “Not today,” so we rerouted to סינמה סיטי and ended up at
          החברים. Nothing went as planned, but somehow everything felt exactly right.

        <h2>🔐 Date 3: Escape Room & Real Talk</h2>
        <p>
          We started with a walk — just a simple, no-pressure stroll that somehow ended up feeling… really good. The
          kind of walk where the world goes quiet, your brain finally stops overthinking, and your heart leans in like,
          “Hey… this might be something.” I couldn’t tell you exactly what we talked about, but I remember how I felt:
          curious, calm, seen — and very much wanting more. Like a lot more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came the escape room — because nothing says romantic tension like being locked in a fake spy mission with
          60 minutes to survive and no backup plan. We played it cool (well, you were cool — I was somewhere between
          sneaky genius and chaotic decoder ring energy). I still believe we opened that last door ourselves, even if
          the host gently disagrees. Let me have my fantasy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You were smooth, collected. I was trying very hard not to be dazzled by your brain. Together, we cracked the
          code with minimal assistance and maximum James Bond energy. (Okay, maybe more Johnny English, but let’s keep
          it sexy.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Dinner at מסעדת בארכה came next — the food? Amazing. But you? Somehow better (Ugh, I know. Cheesy. Let me
          live.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Then came our grand romantic walk on the beach… which we completely forgot to take. We parked, got
          comfortable, and just never left the car. We sat in that quiet little bubble, headlights off, windows up, and
          talked for hours. Like the car itself became a time machine that didn’t want to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          BUT — and this is important — I did download a puzzle game on the car screen, and honestly? That counts as
          beach-adjacent bonding in my book. Just two people, one car, zero sand, and a whole lot of conversation.

        <h2>✈️ Date 4: Mall, Perfumes, and the airport</h2>
        <p>
          You picked me up early, and we headed to TLV Mall. I casually mentioned I might grab a perfume at duty-free,
          but obviously didn’t tell you which one. Because duh? You’d 100% steal my idea. You swore you wouldn’t… and
          then you very charmingly did. Not only that — you went full stealth mode and bought me three. THREE. Honestly?
          I respect the game. Well played, sir.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had a calm breakfast, but my brain was already spiraling into “please don’t miss your flight” mode. Not
          because I wanted you to leave (far from it), but because I knew how much was waiting for you back home, and I
          just wanted it all to go smoothly. You, of course, stayed effortlessly cool while I was the one checking the
          time every two seconds like a frazzled little personal assistant.
        </p>
        <p>
          I told you a friend was picking me up — because I knew you wouldn’t let me come along if I told the truth.
          Classic me, classic you. But then you pulled your own sneaky move: “Let’s get you sorted with the train
          first,” you said, all calm and thoughtful. So we walked over, figured it out, and I was ready to say goodbye…
        </p>
        <p>
          Except I wasn’t. So I looked at you and said, “Okay, I saw it. Let’s go take you to the plane now.” And
          without missing a beat, you agreed. Then — plot twist — you offered to walk me back again. It was a soft
          little tug-of-war of care and goodbyes and not-quite-letting-go, and I swear my heart grew three sizes in that
          moment.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Bonus Moment:</strong> The kiss I sneaked onto your cheek before you left. (I kind of hoped you
          didn’t notice… but I also really hoped you did.)</p>
