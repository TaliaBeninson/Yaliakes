        <h2>🥤 Date 1: Shake & Sea</h2>
        <p>No pics, no proof — but trust me, we were dangerously cute. We grabbed Rebar shakes — or rather, I picked one and you just said, “I’ll have the same,” like this was some kind of blind trust exercise. British bravery or first-date laziness? Unclear. Either way, bold move.</p>
        <p>We sat on a bench by the marina, talked non-stop like two people who forgot they just met, and wandered with absolutely zero purpose — unless you count “being adorable” as a destination. You were calm, sweet, and way too good at making me feel safe. It was suspicious. Are you a wizard?</p>
        <p>Nothing dramatic happened — just a bench, a shake, and one very promising beginning.</p>
        <p><strong>Date Rating:</strong> Cuteness: 9.5/10. Drama: 2/10. Chemistry: high-key dangerous.<br>
        <strong>Bonus Memory:</strong> You forgot to turn the car off and blamed my beauty for it. Creativity points: awarded.</p>

        <h2>🗺️ Date 2: Dead Sea Detours</h2>
        <p>Some couples go on chill second dates. We accidentally auditioned for <em>The Amazing Race: Israel Edition</em>. First stop: מצפה ים המלח — which sounded like a great idea until the GPS took us on a scenic tour through half the Arab villages in the region. Add in a few of those bright red “NO ENTRY for Israelis” signs and suddenly we were starring in a suspense movie with zero backup plan.</p>
        <p>Eventually, we reached the overlook — which turned out to be a sleepy little yeshuv with no sea in sight, minimal vibes, and just the right amount of “should we even be here?” existential crisis. Then we put our hopes in מצדה, dreaming of historical grandeur… only to find it locked up for the day.</p>
        <p>But you? Totally unfazed. While I was internally Googling “how to survive in the Judean desert,” you just kept driving, calm and steady like this was all part of your master plan. (Was it?) We finally made it to the actual Dead Sea, took a walk, and casually stumbled into someone’s proposal. (No, I didn’t say yes. Tempting, though.)</p>
        <p>Later, I taught you Wordle (you're welcome). You tried to take me to your favorite spot in מחנה יהודה, but parking said “Not today,” so we rerouted to סינמה סיטי and ended up at החברים. Nothing went as planned, but somehow everything felt exactly right.</p>
        <p><strong>Date Rating:</strong> Drama: 10/10. Navigation: -infinity. You: suspiciously chill.</p>

        <h2>🔐 Date 3: Escape Room & Real Talk</h2>
        <p>
          We started with a walk — just a simple, no-pressure stroll that ended up feeling surprisingly… good. The kind of walk where your brain quiets down and your heart kind of leans in a little. I don’t remember what we talked about exactly, but I remember feeling like I wanted more of it. Like, a lot more.<br><br>
          Then came the escape room — because what better way to flirt than locking ourselves in a fake spy mission and seeing if we make it out without getting any help from the host (I still believe we opened that last door ourselves). You were smooth, I was sneakier (or so I like to believe), and together we cracked the code — with minimal help and maximum James Bond moves.<br><br>
          Later, we drove to מסעדת בארכה for dinner, where the food was amazing but you were better. (Ugh, I know. Cheesy. Let me live.) After that, we headed to the beach with full intentions of taking a romantic walk… and then never left the car. We just parked, stayed in the car park, and talked. For hours. We literally forgot to exit the vehicle.<br><br>
          BUT — and this is important — I did download a puzzle game on the car screen because I love puzzles, and honestly? That counts as beach-adjacent bonding in my book. Just two people, one car, zero sand, and a whole lot of conversation.<br><br>
          <strong>Date Rating:</strong> Escape skills: elite. Beach walk execution: fail. Car park intimacy: 10/10.

        <h2>✈️ Date 4: Mall, Perfumes, and the Sneaky Gift Reveal</h2>
        <p>
          You picked me up early, and we headed to TLV Mall. I mentioned I might grab a perfume in duty-free, but I definitely wasn’t going to tell you which one — because, duh, you’d just steal my idea. You promised you wouldn’t... but surprise! You totally did. And then you ended up buying me three perfumes. Well played.<br><br>
          We had a calm breakfast, but then I switched into full “please don’t miss your flight” mode. Not because I wanted you to leave, but because you’ve got so much work waiting for you, and I wanted everything to go smoothly. Meanwhile, you stayed completely cool — like you always do — while I was the one checking the clock every two seconds.<br><br>
          We returned the car, and I stayed with you until your plane took off — part “don’t leave,” part “please don’t miss your flight.” Perfectly imperfect, just like us.<br><br>
          <strong>Date Rating:</strong> Sneakiness: 10/10. Airport stress: real. Sentiment level: unreasonably high.<br>
          <strong>Bonus Moment:</strong> The corn British chips that I loved.

        <h2>🎧 Our Soundtrack</h2>
        <p>
          Every love story needs a killer soundtrack — ours just happens to have the perfect mix of soft bops, road trip vibes, and songs I now can’t hear without thinking of you. From singalongs that turned into duets (off-key but full of heart) to those quiet moments when the music filled in what we didn’t say out loud.<br><br>
          Some songs make me smile, some make me miss you, and one or two are borderline illegal for how many feelings they carry now. But all of them? They’re <em>us</em>.<br><br>

        <h2>💗 This Road Feels Good</h2>
        <p>
          Four dates. A thousand laughs. At least seven wrong turns — GPS and emotional alike. But somehow, every step felt like it landed exactly where it was supposed to.<br><br>
          I didn’t expect you. I didn’t plan this. But then you showed up, calm and golden and sneaky-sweet, and suddenly everything felt a little softer. A little brighter. A lot less lonely.<br><br>
          I don’t know where this road leads. But I know I like it better with you in the passenger seat — or the driver’s, as long as you don’t miss another highway exit.<br><br>
          <strong>Love Rating:</strong> Uncharted. Unpredictable. Unfairly good.<br>
          Let’s keep driving. Even if we never figure out the destination.
